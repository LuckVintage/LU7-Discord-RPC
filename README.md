# LU7-Discord-RPC
A simple Python app to set up a custom Discord-rich presence. Currently in development.

Big thanks to [niveshbirangal](https://github.com/niveshbirangal) for the Python code available at https://github.com/niveshbirangal/discord-rpc. The LU7 Discord RPC app wouldn't be possible without his code contributions!
